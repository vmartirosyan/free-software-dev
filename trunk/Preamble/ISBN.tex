{\small
The book is designated for the software developers who plan to start creating free software. Here it is explained what the free software is and the idea of freedom in the software world. Besides this, the reader can find a complete set of tools including editors, IDEs, compilers and other utilities created to ease the process of software development, which are also free. Then we shall study some of the free libraries - GLib, GObject, GThread, GTK+ etc.
And, at last, we shall build a whole complicated free software system, using the tools mentioned earlier.
